# Random-Variate-Generators
Creation of a library of random variate generators from PRNs using Python. My method was to primarily use Inverse Transform Method with PRNs to generate the appropriate distribution. When Inverse Transform was trickier or not possible, I used other tricks as discussed in class, and a special trick for the Gamma Distribution.

functions.py - library that is callable to use the functions

Example Questions.py - Code to work through some example questions for which this library may be useful.

Random Variate Generation Methods.py - shows the usage of each function with a distribution plot for visualization.
