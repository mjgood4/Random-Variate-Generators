# Random-Variate-Generators
Creation of a library of random variate generators from PRNs using Python. My method was to primarily use Inverse Transform Method with PRNs to generate the appropriate distribution. When Inverse Transform was trickier or not possible, I used other tricks as discussed in class, and a special trick for the Gamma Distribution.
